# DandD-Initiative-Roller
Small app in Python to roll and keep track of initiative rolls during combat in Dungeons and Dragons

Nothing fancy. Just keeps track of each character in the fight and their current initiative roll. Allows you to remove characers from combat and re-roll initiative each turn.
Created after my son had trouble keeping track of 32 goblins, 11 bugbears and 5 PCs initiative on paper.
